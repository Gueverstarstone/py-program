# Step 1: Set up your code Create a file called main.py with the following content:

# Step 2: Set a breakpoint

# Click in the gutter (left margin) next to (result = a / b) to set a breakpoint

# A red dot will appear, indicating the breakpoint is set

# Step 3: Start debugging

# Press F5 or go to Run > Start Debugging

# Select "Python File" when prompted

# The debugger will pause execution at your breakpoint

# Step 4: Inspect variables

# Hover over variables to see their current values

# Use the Variables panel on the left to see all local variables

# Use the Debug Console at the bottom to evaluate expressions

# Step 5: Step through code

# Use the debug toolbar to:

# Continue (F5): Resume execution until the next breakpoint

# Step Over (F10): Execute the current line and move to the next

# Step Into (F11): Enter into function calls

# Step Out (Shift+F11): Exit the current function
